Agents and managers can be assigned to one or more departments through the Admin Panel's Agents tab. These departments, which can be either private or public, are used to route tickets in the help desk system. To configure departments, go to the Admin Panel's Agents tab.

To allow agents to efficiently respond to and resolve tickets, they are given access to the help desk and can be assigned to various departments. When adding an agent, you can designate a primary department for them and assign them a primary role for the tickets and tasks routed to that department. Additionally, agents can be given extended access to additional departments within the help desk and assigned different roles for those departments. This allows them to effectively handle a variety of tasks within the help desk system.

In the Agents tab of the Admin Panel, you can assign agents and managers to one or more departments. These departments are used to route tickets in the help desk system and can be either private or public. In addition, you can also set up roles for each department that an agent has access to. These roles consist of a set of permissions that can be enabled or disabled for the agent in that department. You can create an unlimited number of roles and assign them to agents with access to different departments.

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal agreement between a service provider and its customers that outlines the level of service expected from the provider. It typically includes details such as the types of services provided, the performance standards for those services, and the consequences of not meeting those standards. SLAs are commonly used in the IT industry to ensure that customers receive a certain level of service and support from their service provider.To create Service Level Agreement (SLA) Plans in the help desk system, go to the Manage tab in the Admin Panel and click the "Add New SLA Plans" button. These plans outline the expected time frame for closing tickets in the help desk.
